For a new business idea:

In games such as league of legends or any other "grinding" type game, there should be a way to make real money, but regulated. 
Diablo III did it once, but I guess regulation is needed to make it work.
Since so many millions of people play video games already, at least make most gamers "testers."  If possible, I guess.
